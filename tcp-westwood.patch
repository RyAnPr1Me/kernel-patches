Subject: [PATCH] net: Enable TCP Westwood+ for wireless optimization

Enables TCP Westwood+ as an available congestion control algorithm,
which is particularly effective for:

- Wireless networks (WiFi, cellular)
- Networks with variable latency
- Satellite connections
- Mobile gaming and streaming

Works alongside BBR3 from cachyos.patch, providing options for
different network conditions.
