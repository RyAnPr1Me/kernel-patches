Subject: [PATCH] kernel: Enable low-latency desktop preemption model

This patch configures the kernel for low-latency desktop preemption,
optimized for interactive and gaming workloads.

Changes:
- Enable PREEMPT (low-latency desktop) as default
- Set 1000Hz timer frequency for better responsiveness
- Optimize preemption points for lower latency

Benefits:
- Better desktop responsiveness
- Lower input latency for gaming
- Smoother multitasking
- Better frame pacing
